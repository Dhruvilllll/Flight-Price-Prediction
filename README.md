Here's a suggested structure and content for the README file of your "Flight Price Prediction" project on GitHub:

# Flight Price Prediction

## Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict flight prices based on various features such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airlines, and more. The model can assist users in finding the best flight deals and making informed decisions about their travel plans.
